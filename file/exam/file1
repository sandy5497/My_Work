I promise myself that 
nothing can disturb my piece of mind.
to talk health, happiness and prosperity
to every person I meet.
to make all my friend and family member feel that
there is  something important in them.
to look at the sunnyside of everything 
and make my optimism come true.
to talk only of the best,to work only for the best
and to expect the best.
to be just as enthusiastic about the success of others
as I'm about my own.
